 🧺 FreshFold - Laundry & Ironing Service Management System

FreshFold is a full-stack web application designed to digitalize and streamline laundry and ironing services. The system supports both home-based services (pickup and delivery) and in-store walk-in services. It enables customers to schedule pickups, track order progress, and receive their clothes freshly washed and ironed, while also allowing admins and staff to manage operations efficiently through a centralized dashboard.



 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of FreshFold is to modernize laundry service operations by replacing manual processes with a robust and interactive platform. It focuses on:

- Simplifying the customer experience through online booking and real-time order tracking.
- Enabling laundry staff to manage orders, pickups, deliveries, and service statuses effectively.
- Supporting business growth by offering a scalable, tech-driven solution.

Whether the customer walks in or opts for doorstep pickup, FreshFold ensures a smooth, trackable, and reliable laundry experience.
